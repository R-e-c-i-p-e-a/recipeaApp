"Search for Recipeas based on ingredients." 
Our cooking application mainly targets those that are young professionals between the ages of 20-30. We plan to optimize our application for those that have busy schedules (limited time to cook) and may not know how to cook or may struggle to find recipes for the ingredients they have on-hand.
There are many webApps that help users to search of recipes with key ingredients. But it doesn't account for all the other ingredients that user might not have to prepare the dish. Help people by providing instructions or recipes to cook food based on the ingredients they have in the kitchen. Our goal is to provide a WebApp for easy recipe search based on ingredients.
# User Research
What you wanted to learn via interviews and observations
The research we conducted aimed towards understanding our user habits and preferences. Our users were assumed to be young students and professionals who don’t have many ingredients at home, don’t have time to buy many groceries, and most often don’t know how to cook. While all these observations are true. Conducting these interviews helps us understand the additional requirements of the users. 
	We chose to take interviews with potential users of this application. We asked them questions on their lifestyle, cooking habits, and their preferences.
The initial proposal was to build an app that makes recipe suggestions based on ingredients. After the interviews and evaluating Personas & Scenarios the need to make sure that these recipes are quick to prepare also arises. Users who prefer this app are extremely busy and what they prefer is recipe suggestions that make use of few ingredients, quick & easy to prepare and multiple recipe options for the same set of ingredients with dietary restrictions in mind.
